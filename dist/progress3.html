				<li>Braden, Chris, Andrew, and I met to finish soldering the DC motor driver. Braden and I also worked on getting a scan on command button between the user interface, websocket, and micro so that we could toggle scanning. When we plugged in the PCB now, it stopped working, as in the micro was not pulling any power/powering on. We had no idea why, we asked Joe and professor Walter and they weren't sure either and suggested it might've shorted. We probed around the board thinking possibly something was shorting it, maybe the PIR or motor drivers, and we checked every GPIO pin and nothing was shorting and everything that should've had power, had power. After waiting around 20 minutes, it started working again. We then were able to test every feature, and everything worked, so we signed up for our final demo.</li>

We then soldered the PIR sensor on again and attempted to resolder on the dc motor driver but the pads were so word been out, so we waited to get some help from chris to do this.  </li>

				<li>I started working on calibrating the driving in the software, but when I went to test. I found that turning was not working. Chris and I worked on trying to debug this together. I tried increasing the turning speed, but even at max speed, this wasn't enough. We tried only turning one side forward instead of one side forward and one side backwards and this only made the robot go forward. I also tried making the robot go forward and then turn and this kind of worked, but not enough. We found that there were two main issues plaguing us. One being the tires caused way too much friction. Also, the suspension was way too flexible so the tires were bending up, so much so that they were even hitting the shell. So, Chris and I cut the shell a little to make sure no matter how much suspension, the tires wouldn't run into the shell. This still didn't really help the turning. So, We called Andrew over as he had more experience with this stuff. We ended up realizing we could just take the tires off and this pretty much solved our turning issue completely. We further improved on this by putting wooden blocked between the suspension and chassis. I then calibrated the turning to be 90 degrees in the lab. Chris and I then connected the LEDs to the LED mount on the shell. I worked on making the battery life code work with the LEDs, I was running into an issue where it would not decrease and even had Andrew help me debug. I then realized, the issue was a floating point issue, and this fixed the battery life code.</li>

				<li>I then helped solder the PIR sensor to the slip ring. We then put the PIR sensor and the stepper motor on and assembled it with the turrent mount. After a little while of being on and being tested, we realized the PIR sensor started to melt. This was because we wired it wrong and it started to short. After this, we started getting some weird behaviors with the PCB. One of the DC motor drivers stopped working, so we took it off and then we started not being able to flash. We realized that we probably shorted the ESP. So, we started soldering on a new board including the ESP, all the resistors and capacitors for it along with the push buttons, the LEDs for heartbeat sensors along with their resistors, the push buttons and caps and resistors for the ESP, the LDO and its caps and resistors, and the USB connector. After this, it also was not working when attempting to flash, so at this point we called it a night.</li>

				<li>Our battery stopped working and we went to recharge it and it gave an error saying there was a low voltage. We tried jump starting it which was risky but nothing bad happened and the low voltage error went away but then we got an error saying there was an error with the cell count, so we removed the balancing the lead and this worked, but was dangerous so I monitored while it charged and nothing bad happened.</li>

				<li>As a team, we figured out how we were going to orient and control the stepper motor with the PIR along with the slip ring. We finalized our design to be the following: the stepper will connect to the hole on top of the shell. The slip ring will be attached to the stepper below it. The PIR will be attached on a 2-3 inch tall column ontop of the stepper, and the its pins will be bent up vertically. The slip ring will then attach to those vertical pins and this will prevent wires from getting twisted.</li>

				<li>I worked on trying to get the shift register circuit to work with the software. I ran into some issues with the WiFi not working. I ended up recreating the project folder and it ended up connecting to WiFi.</li>
				<li>I tried out the code and it wasn't able to control the shift registers, so I tried debugging it. I rechecked the wiring with the circuit schematic, and the only thing I found wrong was that the second shift register wasn't getting power, but when I fixed that, it still didn't work. I tried checking the code over by recreating it by looking back at our original Arduino prototyping code and converting it to esp-idf code and it still didnt work.</li>
				<li>I was messing around with the original code, and I moved the line for configuring the Gpio pins and it started working. So, we got our LED shift register PSDR (3rd PSDR) checked off.</li>

				<li>I tried getting the shift register PCB circuit working on our PCB. To do this, we had to flywire the shift registers pins (data, clock, and latch) to the micro gpio pins. This still didn't work. I tried measuring the pins with an oscilliscope and was getting a very strange behavior. The pins would output an expected output to the oscilliscope when they werent soldered to the shift register pins, but when they were soldered to the shift register it would jump up to 4v which definitely did not seem right. So, it still would not work. So, I rebuilt the shift register circuit on a breadboard and devboard again with the original prototyping code, and this worked. This confirmed that the code and the circuit schematic itself was not incorrect.</li>
				<li>From this, I thought there was no point struggling with trying to debug the shift register circuit anymore and we couldn't salvage this PCB because we cut so many traces. So, we started on our next PCB. Chris and I soldered on the other components for the new PCB (micro, all the resistors and capacitors and buttons that go along with the micro, the LDO, the heartbeat leds and their resistors, and the power mount). We plugged it in and the micro wouldn't turn on and was not drawing enough power. We tried to debugging it and couldn't find any obvious issues. I ended up resoldering the usb connector and some of the pads on the micro and it worked.</li>

				<li>Instead of putting the shift registers on the PCB they will live on a protoboard because our PCB seemed to have some issue I couldn't find and this was our last PCB we had so I didn't want to risk screwing it up again that made it irrecoverable (later this day we figured out the issue was that, we made pin 10 of the first shift register going to ground but it should be going to power so we cut that trace and flywired it to power but this trace also connected to another ground pin on the shift register and we didn't see this, so it was shorting and causing the shift register to behave incorrectly).</li>

				<li>Andrew and I worked on trying to test the micro on the PCB to debug why the shift register circuit was not working. We did this by measuring the voltage on the pins, and found they were constantly 4v and we couldn't bring them down to 0v. So, we believed the pins were burnt out. So, I cut the traces of the old GPIO pins and found that GPIO pins 47, 24, and 25 could be used.</li>

				<li>I helped assemble part of the CAD shell by supergluing a couple of the pieces together and clamping them together.</li>
				<li>I also helped tried to test if the USB component was the issue with our PCB by helping to resolder and testing flashing on it and the issue still persisted. Because of this issue, we thought maybe it was causing a short or something else was going wrong with it, so I helped desolder it using the hot air gun, and the micro still did not work and was not pulling enough power. Just to be sure, before deciding the board was bricked, I helped solder on a new usb connector, and that still didn't work. At this point we decided this board was totaled.</li>
				<li>We tried hooking up an old board we thought was bricked before we started a new board, and it actually worked. This is good because it already had the micro, the 5-3v3 LDO, heartbeat LEDS, the coulumb counter (untested), and the 18v regulator that doesn't work already soldered. We are going to continue developing this board from this point forward.</li>

				<li>When I got to lab, the board was not flashing again, so we tried resoldering the joints again to the micro and it still didn't work. So then we tried to debug again by probing and asking Joe, and then out of the blue it continued working again. We took this time to get two PSDRs checked off (controlling the board through our websocket/WiFi and controlling motors with PWM).</li>
				<li>We then started to glue some of the shell CAD pieces together with superglue.</li>
				<li>We also got the mta connector for the PIR sensors and soldered that on the board and soldered some wire to the pir and got that hooked up.</li>

				<li>I sanded some more CAD shell parts.</li>
				<li>Last week, Braden found the issue we were having with the shift register circuit was that pin 10 is going to ground but it should be going to power. The issue with this is the via going from ground to the tenth pin is very close together, so we were worried about cutting it. However, I found that we can cut the trace with some ease after practicing it on another board we bricked earlier. So, I cut the trace, and flywired the tenth pin to power. I tested this and it worked.</li>
				<li>We couldn't fully test to see if it works because the latch gpio pin seems to be burnt out so I flywired that too which was pretty challenging since the vias for extra gpio pins were made too small, so I had to flywire it directly to the micro pads. We went to tests this and found the micro was not able to flash. We tried debugging this by probing around the board, we found there were no shorts. The behavior was when the board was powered, it would have a regular current pull of around 1 amp which means the micro is on and working, but then after trying to flash or after waiting enough time it would go down to around .3 amps which is just the pull of the LEDs and a few other parts on the board. When we tried to flash, it would not be able to find the device. I then tried cutting the flywires from earlier in hopes one of the flywires was changing the way the board behaved negatively, but that didn't do anything. We tried probing to see if the micro was getting power and it was. I then thought that maybe some of my flywiring directly to the micro messed up a solder joint, so I resoldered the joint for the reset button and everything started to work (spoiler alert: I didn't fix the issue).</li>

				<li class="issues">Andrew and I spent a lot of time trying to debug the shift register section. I tried reprogramming the devboard and using circuit on the breadboard and that didn't work. Then, we focused on going back to the prototyping process by programming an arduino and the breadboard circuit and that also didn't work. We got very confused at this point because this circuit and the arduino code worked at one point. We thought maybe the chips might be burnt out, but after getting new ones, they still didn't work. We probed the inputs and every signal seemed right, so at this point we are really confused and decided to move on to focus on other sections and come back to this.</li>
				<li>I soldered on the stepper motor control components (TVSs, motor connector, resistors, debugging LEDs). We plugged it in and it didn't end up working, and so we probed around it and found that the signal was dropping over the LEDs and one of them was only dimly on. We found that the debugging LEDs were actually dropping the voltage too much, so we just unsoldered them and solder bridged them instead.</li>

The original code was not working with the PCB, so I started isolating just the functions we were trying to test into a new file, and this worked for just the stepper motor, so at this point we found the stepper motor is completely integrated. I then did the same with the LEDs again just to try again, and to no surprise it still didn't work. I then added in the original WiFi functions and web socket functions and this worked.

				<li>I went to get the usb soldering xrayed and there were no shorts. So, I tried flashing a test file on the micro and it flashed!</li>
				<li>I then soldered on all connectors, 8 of the resistors, and all three of shift registers for the LED section.</li>
				<li>I tried flashing our main code onto the micro and ran into a lot of issues. The WiFi wasn't connecting and the LEDs weren't turning on.</li>
				<li>I then made sure my code was right by flashing it on our devboard and it still worked, so I was confused what was going on. After doing research, I couldn't find anyone else having a similar issue where their code worked on the devboard and not on the vwroom1. After trying a few different things, I tried flashing the default example code for connecting to WiFi and it worked for some reason so we are going to combine all our code into this version of the code.</li>
				<li>We tried debugging the led section by probing the latch, data, and clock vias and everything seemed to be working but the output is just noise, so we think the issue might be with the shift registers themselves and they may be burned out or something (we made sure their pins were lined up right and they are).</li>

				<li>Chris, Andrew, and I worked together for this portion.</li>
				<li>We tested the current board and found that the solder paste was causing a lot of shorts. From visual inspection this was clear, and we found that when we measured the ohmage between power and ground there was a very little ohmage meaning there was a short. We tried cleaning up the solder paste, but could not resolve all the shorts. Because of this, we decided to once again start over.</li>
				<li>We started over soldering again and after soldering on several components we made a frustrating mistake and accidentally pulled some pads off meaning we had to start over again as it was no recoverable.</li>
				<li>We started over again and actually made a lot of progress with no errors. We soldered on the power connector, the 3v3 and 5v heartbeat leds/resistors, the boot/reset buttons/resistors/caps, the programmer connector, the micro and its respective resistors/caps.</li>
				<li>We tried programming it with the 362 programmer and we could not get it to flash.</li>
				<li>We tried probing around and testing the pins for the rx and tx, and tried looing into the esp-idf to see if that was the problem and couldn't find any issues.</li>
				<li>We pivoted to soldering on the usb connector, but we didn't want to test it because we wanted to make sure with an xray that there was no shorts.</li>

The LED mount is made up of a bottom bridge on the top of the MOUSE shell and then the actual piece the 24 LEDs will be glued into will then connect to the bridge. The stepper motor will be placed in the hole on the top and then the slip ring will be attacked to the top of the motor and then the PIR sensor will be attached on top of the slip ring.

				<li class="issues">We then decided to test it and it didn't work as we expected. With 18v going in, we checked the 5v out and it was only giving anywhere between 0.2v and 1.5v instead of the expected 5v. We then checked to make sure the 18v pin was actually getting 18v and it was so we know the coulumb counter is not part of the problem. I then started probing around the QFN chip, I found that the voltage divider seemed to be working as expected, other than the fact that the output voltage is too low. All the grounds came up as the correct voltage too, so no shorting on the grounds. There was one part where we scratched a pad yesterday on the voltage regulat qfn that is really close to touching another pad, so I checked to see if that was shorting and the voltages on the two pads aren't the same, so I don't think they're shorting. Once Chris showed up, he recommended that we test the ohmage of the resistors, so we started to do that and some of the resistor values didn't seem right, so that is the next place to look for a possible root cause.</li>

				<li>Braden has been working on the PWM component of our project, and Chris and I met up with him to help him debug some issues he was having. The first thing we did was check to make sure what his issue was; we tried to hook up the esp to the pwm circuit and run the pwm esp code and it didn't work. We hooked up the output directly from the ESP to a oscilliscope and saw it was generating a PWM signal. Then we hooked up a DMM to the output of the DC motor driver and found it was pulling zero current. We prototyped with an Arduino which worked before so we hooked up an Arduino back to the circuit and ran the original prototyping arduino code and it experienced the same issue. Because of this, we started to think we burnt out the motor driver chip. So, we hooked up one we weren't using to the arduino and this finally worked. So then, thinking it was just the motor driver chip, we plugged in the esp to the motor driver chip again and ran that code, but it was having the same issue as before. So, after looking more at the circuit between the esp and the motor driver, we realized the circuit was wrong, and because of this we realized the other motor driver chips we thought were burnt out werent and were instead just wired wrong. Then we tried the code again and it still didnt work, so we definitely narrowed down the problem to now just a software issue. I then rewrote the PWM code from scratch using the arduino code as a reference but in the esp-idf instead and it finally worked. Below is the code that worked.</li>

				<li>Andrew and Chris worked on adding a new buck converter to replace the old one, but were having difficulties making the pads connect to the power plane, so I helped them out and debugged their issue (the issue was that there were polygons placed under the pads of the footprint which were interfering with the routing capabilities, along with the pads also not being extended out far enough), so now the respective pads are able to connect to the power plane/be routed to their specific power.</li>
				<li>I also fixed a few other issues, such as routes missing in a few different spots. And, then I also fixed an error we were were having with another set of ICs where they weren't having enough connection points to the power plane which caused an error with the thermal relief, so I fixed this by extending the pads.</li>
				<li>I then finished the pcb checklist for the remaining things not done when I worked on it on 2/24 at 11:00. I realized that the issue with the vias not being untented wasn't actually an issue because when ordering from JLCPCB we can just make every via untented since there are no vias that we need tented. Additionally, I fixed a decent amount of silkscreen overlaps with the regulator changes. I also checked the Gerber file for any errors and found none. And, I also increased the size of some vias to match their route sizes.</li>

				<li>I tested to see if our schematic for the TVS placement on the stepper motor was right. The schematic originally had the two TVS between pins 1 and comm and 2 and 4. However, after testing this and it not working properly, I talked with Chris and he found a circuit diagram going having the placement between 1-3 and 2-4 so I tried that and it worked.</li>
				<li>I also tested having the whole circuit hooked up at the same time on a breadboard and everything seemed to work fine which was good.</li>
				<li>I then worked on the PCB checklist did the following</li>

				<li>I began working on looking into the coulumb counter for monitoring the battery life. After doing a decent amount of research, I stumbled throughout the following four references. Most of the coulumb counters I could find were all rated for under 20v which is problematic because our input voltage is 18.5v. I looked into see if it was okay to put the coulumb counter after out 18.5 to 5v regulator would be okay, but from what I saw online, it seemed like that would not provide an accurate result. So, I continued to look and finally stumbled upon the LTC2944 which allows for a 60v input. This will be the coulumb counter that we will use.</li>

I checked the config to see if interrupts needed to be enabled in FREERTOS, but they were already enabled. I also tried to changing between falling edge and rising edge interrupts, but that didn't change anything. My first iteration of code, didn't use a queue, but I found that if you try and use printf in the interrupts it will crash because of its asynchronous nature. So, that is what the queue is for in the code below. Again, though, this code doesn't work, so I am trying to get it to work in the next work session. The code can be seen below.</li>

				<li>I then decided to work on the state control in the esp code. The code I snipped above already has part of this new code. This new code is pretty scattered, so I won't show any screenshots, but I'll explain it instead. There are only two states currently: manual control (state 0) and scanning for movement (state 1). If its in state 0, it will send requests through the websocket to request for the motor direction. If it is state 1, then it will turn on the stepper motor control and send requests through the websocket for whether movement was detected or not (will talk about websocket code later in this section). When we get our third state, replay mode, the scanning mode will turn on every x amount of seconds automatically. So, to prepare for that, I made it so that every 60 seconds, the scanning state is turned on for 20 seconds, and then goes back to manuual control mode. In the final design, manual control mode will never be interruped by scanning mode, but again, this is just to prepare for the functionality that will be used when replay mode is implemented.</li>
				<li>Like I said, there were a lot of small changes in the esp code for this section, so to encompass all the little changes, the current esp code is attacked below.</li>

				<li>I also added in the stop button to the esp code, but since that was a small change, you can just see that in the text file linked above (ESP code up to this point)</li>
				<li>I then worked on modifying the websocket and frontend code to read in from the microcontroller whenever there is motion detected and storing the time it was detected and then displaying that in the message box. The code to do all this can be seen below.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This code is the websocket code for receiving whether there was movement detected. It then sends the time it was recorded to another function which will be below this.</li>

However, when I did the 1 millisecond delay in the esp-idf env. it kept crashing and giving the following error: E (5316) task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered.

				</li>
				<li>One thing I tried to get around the previous issue was by turning the delay down to 10 milliseconds, but this caused the motor turn really slow and vibrate a lot, and I am pretty sure that was bad for the motor and the speed wasn't optimal either. So, I kept trying to find another solution. One thing I found was that FreeRTOS sets the default threshold to be 10 ms, so I had to go into the configuration and raise this up to allow for 1000 ticks a second. This was done by doing the following</li>
				<ul>
					<li>idf.py menuconfig</li>
					<li>Component config > FreeRTOS > Tick Rate (Hz)</li>
					<li>Change 100 to 1000</li>
				</ul>
				<li>After all this, the stepper motor with the esp finally worked!</li>

			<ul class="progress">
				<li>I tested whether the sonar sensor itself was actually broken by running the code that was given in the datasheet for the sensor for an Arduino. From this testing, I found that the sensor itself was not actually working. The code to test this in Arduino is as below.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="Team\progress\img - member3\arduinoSonar.txt" target="__blank">Arduino code for sonar</a></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Because we concluded the sonar does not work, we pivoted to trying to use an ultrasonic sensor instead. This is because we looked at the datasheet for the ultrasonic sensors we have (HCSR04) and it says they have a range of 12 feet which should be good enough.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The below code is for the esp to interface with the ultrasonic sensor</li>

						Ultrasonic sensor data
					</div>
					<li>However, the issue is that it stopped collecting data at around 3 feet which is definitely too small of a range</li>
				</ul>
				<li>We decided to pivot by instead using a pir sensor and a stepper motor. We will attach the pir sensor to the motor. This will allow us to turn the motor and read from the sensor so we can get a full 360 read with only one sensor. Additionally, the sensor is different from the sonar/ultrasonic because it only reads in a digital value of whether there is movement or not, so this more feets our need since we are only looking for movement anyway.</li>

			<ul class="issues">
				<li>When looking at the sonar sensor data today, it seems that it is not working correctly. The recorded distance is not at all accurate and seems completely random. I thought yesterday when I was working on this I got it to work, but I didn't do extensive testing, so there is a chance it was never actually working and instead my small bits of testing just led to coincidental data that seemed correct.</li>
				<li>To try and debug whether the I2C code was the issue, one thing I tried was changing the default address of the peripheral which you can see the values to do this in the figure titled "Sonar Sensor I2C key for addresses". This didn't seem to do anything and the values were still random. This result didn't really provide more information on what the issue was.</li>
				<li>One other thing I did to try and debug was change the frequencies of data transmission for I2C, but this didn't change anything.</li>
				<li>Because nothing seemed to be helping the debugging process, I think the next logical step is to try and prototype this with an Arduino and see if Arduino code can interface with it which should be easier. If that ends up not working either, then I'm just going to suggest that the sensor is problematic and we try a different one. If it doesn't work, I'll try another approach with the esp code.</li>

						Most of these changes were just some simple html and css changes, so no point in showing that. But here is the new interface.

The motor control requests work very similarly to the previous code I have outlined for the LED control. For now, a request for getting the motor direction is just being sent in parallel to the LED control, but soon it will only send one type of request at a time given the provided state by the user.

				<li>I worked on getting the status of the microcontroller to be accurately stored on the websocket which wasn't currently working. Last week, Braden and I tried to do this by storing the connection persistently in a variable in the websocket file. However, we figured out there is no good way to store a variable persistently in the websocket file. My first idea was to do a really bad bandaid fix by just checking if the number of clients is 1 and use the assumption that if there is only 1 client on then it is the webserver client, but I really hated that idea. So, I decided we would do this the same way we are controlling the micro peripherals like the LED and store it in the apiData text file. The way this works is when the micro connects to the websocket sends a specific connection message every few seconds (made it every few seconds so it doesnt impact the latency of other requests too much). Then on the websocket server, the time this request is received is stored in the apiData text file. Then when the webserver refreshes it sends a websocket request to retrieve the time being stored for micro connection status. If the time is more than 10 seconds from the current time, then it displays that the micro is not connected and says it is connected otherwise. The code below will show this in greater detail.</li>

						Below is the code that the micro sends where you can see every 5 iterations it sends a request telling the websocket it is still connected

				<li class="think">I also found that the type of WiFi seems to change the throughput threshold for thw webhook requests. Last week, I got the webhook frequency to be ~0.5 seconds and that was when I was connected to my mobile hotspot. However, when I connected to my local WiFi today, I found it was struggling to maintain that frequency and had to be brought down to around ~5 seconds. So, that brings me to believe the type of WiFi matters or at least the type of WiFi connection matters. From now on, all testing will be done on a hotspot unless we find a way to make the connection to a local WiFi the same as the connection to a mobile hotspot between the ESP. </li>

				<li>Tried to connect the esp to PAL3.0 and eduroam wifi and had some difficulties so found that connecting to a hotspot is probably the way to get around this from this point on.</li>
				<li>Braden updated some of the webhook endpoints and changed the naming scheme around by adding square brackets and I noticed that change caused the lag to increase by a decent amount. This led me to think maybe the length of the data being sent through the websocket is a factor in the lag. Because of this, I tried decreasing the data being sent in each websocket request and found I could get the lag to <= 0.5 seconds which is a big improvement from the previous <= 2 seconds. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>I continued this development by decreasing the data for the rest of the websocket requests from the microcontroller.</li>
					<li>I also added in an initial request from the microcontroller that tells the websocket that the microcontroller specifically connected because the websocket doesn't inherently know what device each connection is from.</li>
				</ul>
				<li class="issues">I also tried to help Braden a little to try and display the microcontroller connection status to the webpage. We were running into some issues as the status kept coming back as not connected even when the microcontroller was indeed connected. My hypothesis for why this is is because I think the variables (even when global) in our websocket are not persistent because I know that regular api endpoint variables are not persistent. The weird thing is is that there is another endpoint that Braden made that keeps track of all the clients connected and sends each of them a message, and that works fine, so it seems that some variables can be persistent. One work around that we can do in the future for this is just storing the microcontroller connection status in the apiData.txt file that we keep other variables we want to be persistent like the ledStatus or the moving instructions.</li>

However, up to 2 seconds of delay shouldn’t be too big of a deal as long as the robot is controlled with a low speed.</li>

				<li class="issues">The issue I spent hours trying to figure out and searching around for online was to do with the following:</li>
				<ul class="issues">
					<li>A strange behavior was occurring where the microcontroller would be able to send about a request or two per second (as expected). Then after a few seconds it would stop, it would then wait for ~4 seconds and this would sometimes be double or triple that time. Then it would send a whole load of requests (20-30) and then start sending a request or two per second again… and then of course repeat the cycle. This means that there is a very inconsistent data travel time which leads to sometimes around 8-12 seconds of delay which is a big problem since we were planning on using the websocket to receive data when to move forward, left, right, etc.</li>
					<li>		○ Another interesting piece of information is that sometimes (not always, but the majority of the time) the ~4 second delays would be accompanied by the following message:  
						W (24808) wifi:[ADDBA]rx delba, code:39, delete tid:0 I (24808) wifi:ba-delidx:0, tid:0 I (25548) wifi:ba-addidx:0 (ifx:0, 10:be:f5:1b:89:c4), tid:0, ssn:64, winSize:64 I (25548) wifi:ba-delidx:0, tid:0 I (25558) wifi:ba-addidx:0 (ifx:0, 10:be:f5:1b:89:c4), tid:0, ssn:65, winSize:64</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I was not able to find any information or other people talking about this online so I became stuck at this point (however, it seems like it could be a throughput issue because of this warning message) and I am now considering not controlling the movement (which highly depends on low latency) with the websocket and instead possibly with RF</li>

				<li>Decided to take a different route by using an express websocket instead of a vue websocket because I couldn't find a solution the error in the last progress section.</li>
				<li>That ended up working and I got the frontend to communicate to the backend and do the toggle light script from last week working, so when the user presses the button it hits the websocket and changes the text in the status text folder and flips the light on or off.</li>

					Frontend Websocket Code 
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Another pro of switching to a web socket is it actually makes the frontend code a lot more simple and all that is needed is an initial websocket connection, send a message to the websocket whenever necessary, and record the return data. Later on, there may need to be some logic added to handle reconnections if that becomes a problem.</li>

					Websocket Initial Backend Code
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>This code is similar to the frontend code but obviously in the backend. So all that is needed is to handle any incoming connections and then anytime is gets a message to begin any necessary scripts and send back any return data. And then also to handle client disconnections. Like I said in the frontend portion, we may need to handle reconnections later on if that becomes a problem later on.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>From the frontend connection, this code already seems a little faster. However, frontend wasn’t having a speed problem with the previous API implementation, so the microcontroller connection is what will really tell if this change was helpful or not.</li>

					Updated the API endpoint to toggle the light to write and read to a local file on the ec2 instance instead of an RDS because it seems there is no free solution with the RDS. So, the API endpoint to toggle the LED now reads from a local apiData text file and updates the value accordingly.

					Added another endpoint to read from the file which is what the microcontroller will use. The functionality of this endpoint is to read from the local text file and parse to get the value of the LED status, and then return it to the microcontroller.

				<li>
					I integrated the call to the new reading light api endpoint to the http requests microcontroller code and added in code to check if the value returned corresponds to an on or off led. I also added the code to control an external LED for the microcontroller.

							What this will do is hit the API endpoint for turning on a light. That API endpoint will change a value locally stored. Another API endpoint will be made to check the value in the database. The ESP will constantly be hitting this API endpoint which will allow it to retrieve the value in the database. And if the value is true, it will turn on the light and if it false it will turn of the light. This is acting as a prototype for how the motor control will work and is using an LED instead for simplicity.

					Got a prototype example script to work for sending http requests to aws api and got the right result
					<ul>
						<li>
							The code can be found here: https://github.com/cmiotto20/477Grp2/tree/main/http_request
						</li>
						<li>TLDR: The code does not connect to the WiFi and instead you have to connect to the local WiFi manually in the microcontroller configuration files (this is a temporary solution until I implement the code to connect to WiFi programatically). What this code does do is take in an IP, a port, and an endpoint name. Then it hits the API endpoint and gets back the request as a buffer. It then prints out the buffer by looping through it.</li>

						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="Team\progress\img - member3\api2.png" class="picture"></img>
						</li>
						<li>
							From these two screenshots you can see that the first API call got a 200 response which means the api returned a OK response and it got the following JSON response: "This API call was a success (as expected)"; this response is directly from the API call which shows we are retrieving the data correctly from the API endpoint. A similar result can be seen from the second screenshot, but with different data and responses to show that this works consistently with different API endpoints.

				<li>Started and finished project proposal with team</li>
				<li>Went on tour of lab</li>
				<li>Brainstormed and discussed how we would approach the project as a team. Decided on trying to use 4 ultrasonic sensors and a lidar. We also decided we would use a premade chassis but CAD and 3D print the body of the robot. We also decided we would use AWS as our web interface and have our WiFi connected microcontroller request to send and receive data to the server via an API. We also decided on our PSDRs which can be seen on our 477 website. </li>
				<li>Gathered components for project: ESP, Shift registers, Chassis, LEDs, resistors</li>
