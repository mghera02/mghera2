	I am a senior in computer engineering and the honors college from Salt Lake City, Utah. I have interned at ODLink as a software developer working in Filemaker. Last summer I interned at Texas Instruments as an Automation Engineer where I worked on manufacturing automation. Some of my technical interests include robotics and programming. My non-technical interests include soccer (playing and watching), hiking and skiing.
