			I met with Matt, Chris and Braden to prepare MOUSE for the final checkoffs then receive the final checkoffs. Just before the checkoffs, we were unable to control anything through our ESP because it would not power on. We began debugging by taking the ESP out of the shell and probing each pin. After a few minutes, the PCB started working as again so we put it back in the shell and connected all peripherals. Intially, the PCB was not working again but after some time and only connecting one peripheral at a time, we were able to demonstrate the capabililties of MOUSE.
			We earned 4 base PSDR checkoffs, and one stretch PSDR checkoff.<br>

			In preparation for our meeting with course staff to get the final checkoffs, I reviewed the relevant documentation and made sure we had everything in order. I also revised Assignment A13 and made some adjustments to the individual contribution section. The next step is meeting with course staff to receive our final checkoffs.<br>

			I worked with Matt, Braden and Chris to test the ESP once everything was soldered onto the PCB again. We also connected all components to the ESP and assembled it into the chassis. Initally, the PCB was not working, and the ESP was not pulling enough current to turn on. We took the PCB out of the chassis, connected it to the power supply and probed each pad to debug what could be causing the issue. Eventaully, the ESP started working again.
			We assembled the PCB and everything into the chassis. After turning it on while connected to the battery, the ESP took about 2 minutes to boot then it worked well enough for us to test all of MOUSE's features. I also worked with Matt to paint the final pieces of the robot shell that will be used as an access panel and the mast for the PIR sensor to mount to the stepper motor. We also painted a logo and some nice detail onto the main part of the shell.
			The next step is reviewing documentation then meeting with the course staff for our final checkoffs.<br>

			I worked with Matt and Braden to test the PCB with everything on it that we replaced the ESP on. This test was successful so we soldered the header for the PIR header on. We also attempted to solder on a new motor driver, but struggled due to the number of times the pads had been soldered. The next step is getting help from Chris to solder the motor driver onto the board then testing it.<br>

			I worked with Matt and Braden to solder a new ESP onto the PCB with everything on it. Following Joe's advice, we cleaned the ESP with lots of alcohol then left the PCB for a few hours to completely dry. The next step is testing the new ESP.<br>

			Matt, Chris and I discussed strategies to reduce the friction between the rubber wheels and ground that was making it difficult for MOUSE to turn. We found the best solution to be taking the rubber tires and foam infill off the rims to be the best solution. I cut pieces of wood and secured them as spacers between the motors and chassis to reduce the amount of movement the suspension could have.
			I made some adjustments to the server-side software including adding endpoints for the website to update the playback state based on the buttons, and the ESP to check playback state. While testing MOUSE and its capabilities, the ESP burned out due to connecting the PIR sensor incorrectly and causing a short. To debug the issues we were having before we realized the ESP was fried, we removed one of the DC motor controllers that stopped working due to the ESP issues and the header for the PIR sensors.
			We soldered a new ESP and micro-usb port onto a different PCB that only had power components on it, but were unable to flash this ESP. We also removed the fried ESP from the PCB with everything on it. The next step is asking Joe for advice, and soldering a new ESP onto the PCB with everything on it.<br>

			I worked with Matt to finish paining the base of MOUSE black by adding more coats of spray paint. I also glued two more sections for the top of the shell onto the rest of the top section of the shell. I worked with Matt and Chris to assemble the base section of MOUSE. I worked with Matt to test the movement control of MOUSE including variable motor speed. We discovered one of the motor controllers was not varying its speed correctly and needs to be replaced.
			I also spent time reading the server-side code to understand the path following functionality works so I can help with future software development. The next step is replacing the motor controller on the PCB.<br>

			I finished soldering wires onto LEDs for shift registers, and added MTA connectors to the soldered wires. We now have 24 LEDs with extended wires soldered onto them and MTA connectors attached. I worked with Chris to test the external buck converter stepping down from the battery (18.5V) to 5V with 7A output. I worked with Chris to use a dremel to cut a hole in the bottom section of the shell for mounting the external buck converter which will also be used as our power switch.
			I also worked with Matt and Chris begin painting the base section of the MOUSE shell with the first coat of black spray paint. The next step is finishing painting MOUSE then assembling and testing all its components.<br>

			I got a protoboard from the ECE shop and soldered two shift registers to it. I also soldered 16 male MTA connectors to the protoboard and enough resistors for one shift registeer to output to 8 LEDs. I also soldered power, ground, latch, data and clock from the first protoboard so it can be controllered in series with the first. The next step is soldering the resistors and signal wires for the second shift register.<br>

			I debugged the issue we were having with the shift registers on our PCB. I found the issue to be when we cut the trace to conneect pin 10 on the shift registers to power insteead of ground, that also cut the trace for the ground of each shift register. This caused the shift register to no longer be able to function
			since the IC was no longer connected to ground. I worked with Matt to begin soldering a shift register onto a protoboard, and we tested it with a single LED and fly-wiring signals from the PCB using the vias for shift register signals. We also fly-wired power and ground from the PCB, using the 5V input and ground on the 5V-3.3V LDO.
			I also began soldering resistors onto the PCB for the motor drivers. The next steps are soldering the motor drivers onto the PCB and finishing soldering the protobaord.<br>

			Worked with Matt to test the microcontroller on our PCB to debug why the shift registers were not working. We found the pins connecting to the shift registers are burnt out but no other pins on the microcontroller are. I also continued soldering wires to extend LEDs so they will reach to the outside of our packaging. For the MTA connectors in stock,
			I connected them to the LEDs we had and asked the course staff to order the remaining LEDs we need to attach to MTA connectors. The next step is finishing extending all the LEDs and adding MTA connectors.<br>

			I identified a possible cause for the issues when flashing to the ESP32 as broken solder connections between the micro usb port and our PCB. After Chris and Matt soldered the connections, I inspected them under a microscope to make sure the connections were strong and there were no shorts between pins. I also worked on soldering LEDs onto 28awg wires that
			will connect to the shift registers and be mounted on the outside of the MOUSE shell. The next step is to solder more wires so we have 24 total LEDs, and add MTA connectors to these soldered wires so they can connect to the PCB.<br>

			I finished extending each of the wires coming off the motors on the chassis. Now each of the motor wires can reach the PCB when the PCB is sitting on top of the robot chassis. I also helped Matt when we were trying to debug the issues with the Microcontroller flashing and booting by thinking of places where the problem may be occuring
			and probing different GPIO pins and points around the PCB. The next step is finding a more reliable fix to the microcontroller working or soldering our final PCB.<br>

			I worked with Matt for most of ManLab to debug the shift register susbsytem. After trying to use an ESP32 devboard to control LEDs on a breadboard which was unsuccessful, we reverted to the beginning of the prototyping process. We attempted to use basic Arduino code to hopefully just get a single 595 shift register working to control some LEDs.
			While using Arduino code from Arduino's documentation, we were still unable to get the shift registers to work. We utilized an oscilloscope to probe the outputs from the Arduino, and the clock signal did not look reasonable but all others did. We also tried multiple Arduinos and pin combinations to rule out any GPIO pins being burnt out.
			This left us extremely confused as the code was utilized from the Arduino documentation so we moved on to other tasks. The next step in this process is coming back to trying to prototype with a different Arduino after getting other sections of our PCB to work.
			Worked with Matt to attempt to debug issues with shift registers and LEDs using an Arduino. By using the oscilloscope to probe pins, we discovered the clock output from the Arduino to the shift register was not as expected. The next step for this part of our design is figuring out why the clock output is incorrect and resolving this issue, then testing with the ESP.<br>
			I also compiled a list of components to order so we can attempt the power section of the PCB we are currently working on, and if something goes wrong with the current board we can aseemble a fifth. After compiling this list, I filled out and submitted the <a href="Team\progress\img - member1\3-28-mouser.xlsx">purchase request</a>.<br>

			I worked with Matt and Chris for this entire work period. We first tested board that had coulomb counter and DC voltage regulator soldered on with solder paste. Found that the solder paste was causing many shorts between power, ground and other pins. To confirm our visual inspection, we measured the resistance between our 18.5V and ground, finding a relatively low resistance indicating a short.
			We repeated the same process to test the 5V plane and ground, and found a relatively low resistance indicating a short. We started over on a new PCB, starting with the 5V-3.3V LDO then the ESP32. When soldring the microcontroller onto the board, we accidentally pulled off a couple pads for the microcontroller which was not recoverable. This led us to start over on a new PCB, our 4th overall, 
			and made strong progress by sucessfully soldering on the 5V-3.3V LDO, 5V and 3.3V heartbeat LEDs, ESP32 and its supporting hardware. We tested the ESP32 through the USB to UART programmer from ECE 362 and were not able to sucessfully flash the ESP32. To make sure everything was soldered correctly, we probed around the ESP32 pins, particularly Tx and Rx, and read through documentation for flashing the ESP32 with UART.
			We shifted to solder on the USB connector to flash the ESP32 through this connection, but did not test because we wanted to X-RAY the pins for inspection first. The next step is X-RAYing the USB connector to make sure no pins are soldered together then flashing the ESP32 through this USB.<br>

			Worked with Braden and Chris to test flasing ESP on first PCB after Chris finished soldering push buttons onto first PCB. We were not able to sucessfully flash ESP, supporting our theory that the first ESP likely got burnt out while soldering. Organized all components to begin assembling a second PCB with couloumb counter and DC Voltage Regulator components.
			Worked with Braden to apply solder paste to pads then carefully lay out all components for Coloumb Counter and Buck Converter on PCB. Then used reflow heat plates to solder components onto PCB. Next step is verifying the Coulomb Counter and Buck Converter ICs are properly soldered with X-RAY then testing coulmb counter and DC Voltage Regulator on new PCB.<br>

			Worked with Chris to solder ESP and supporting capacitors and resistors. Scorched pad on R1 when attempting to create solder bridge for the 0Ohm resistor used as support for ESP. This was solved by using a fly-wire between C2 and R2. Attempted to flash ESP but realized we need to add the push buttons and remaining supporting hardware for ESP as the ESP was not being powered, and needs the push buttons to be flashed.
			We have some concern the ESP is burnt out due to it getting very warm while soldering ground pad underneath. Next step is finishing soldering supporting hardware for ESP then attempting to flash ESP again.<br>

			During manlab I worked with my team to finalize our PCB and get it checked by Joe. We submitted our order through JLCPCB for 5 PCBs; the final PCB and Gerber files can be found on our team website <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp2/Files/documents.html">here</a>. I also started practicing soldering 0805 resistors so I am ready to solder our PCB after spring break. While practicing soldering, I also practiced desoldering with a wick.
			I updated the Mouser order form based on the change of a capacitor from 0603 to 0805 then submitted the order forms for both PCB components and other components required for MOUSE. This gives us enough PCB components for two full PCBs.<br>

			Updated PCB to increase size of traces for 18V power input going to coulomb counter and DC voltage regulator to be approximately 4mm based on the amount of peak current we expect to draw (approximately 6A). Also changed resistor for coulomb coutner R9 to be size 2512 so it's easier to solder with the large traces nearby. Filled out order forms for components necessary to assmeble 2 complete PCBs  (1 backup)
			and have components necessary for rest of MOUSE such as filament to print the shell and a slip ring for the PIR sensor mast. Next step is getting course staff to verify our PCB then submitting the order forms and ordering the PCB.<br>

			Discussaed sensor choice with team after Matt's struggle with Sonar and ultrasonic deosn't have long enough range. Settled on using a PIR sensors and adjusting our PSDRs accordingly. Made changes to PSDRs and project description based on discussion with course staff and change of sensor. Ordered PIR sensors so we can test with them before finalizing the PCB.
			Discussed battery choice with team and decided to switch from SLA battery to LiPo due to power density of LiPo and our chosen robot chassis only being able to support about 3kg. Used TI WEBENCH Power Designer to design 18.5V to 5V step down switching regulator as the LiPo battery we are using is 18.5V.

			Continued making progress with ESP32-S3 schematic, but became confused when working to understand what to do for the RF module. While researching what to do for the RF module, I realized we should switch to the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 chip due to its onboard RF module which is a feature we will be using.
			After seraching for an example schematic to get started with using the chip, started creating schematic for ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 based on DevKit schematic. Next step is to search for more examples using ESP-32-WROOM-1 to continue the schematic design, maybe asking course staff for advice regarding thie element of the pcb design.<br>

			Got familarized KiCAD from reading documentation and following the 555-timer tutorial for getting started and creating a simple schematic. Created schematic for 3 daisy chained shift registers (HC74595) connected to LEDs and ESP32 using KiCAD based on breadboard prototype. The resistors used are all 200Ω. This begins the process of designing our PCB.
			Researched which ESP32 to use for PCB and realized 3.3V is required to power the chip instead of 5V as we initally thought; other components such as motors and the shift registers us 5V power input.

			Constructed circuit on breadboard to use 3 74HC595 shift registers daisy chianed together to control 24 LEDs while only using 3 outputs from the microcontroller (control clock, latch and data). For testing the circuit, an Arduino Uno was used due to the amount of documentation available, and its user-friendly interface for prototyping.
			On the circuit shown below, 300ohm resistors were used between the ICs and LEDs to ensure the LEDs would not be burnt out while testing. This prototype relates to our PCB design as it will include the ICs. The code used to test the circuit and turn on one LED at a time while keeping the previous LEDs powered is shown in a screenshot below.
			The next step with this is debugging the circuit and code becuase only the green and yellow sets of LEDs turn on (controlled by the first two shift registers). I also gained IAM access to our AWS server and understood the file structure being used.</br>

			Researched the difference between 74HC164 and 74HC595 shift registers for use in our project to control 24 LEDs. I decided on 74HC595 timers due to their ability to be daisy chained which will save pins on our PCB. 74HC595s also have the advantage of having a latch. The next step is prototyping the circuit on a breadboard with 3 74HC595s in series to control 24 LEDs; this relates to PSDR #2.<br>

			Disassembled six wheel drive chassis, shown in the image on the right below, to help test all the motors. Adapted the chassis to keep the same length, but change to four wheel drive and add strength as shown in the image on the left below.
			Disassembling and assembling the drive chassis required the use of allen wrenches, needle nose pliers and screwdrivers. The connectors also had to be cut off the motors as the wires were fed through the frame before the connectors were put on preventing the chassis from being disassembled.</br>
