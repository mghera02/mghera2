	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	I am a senior in computer engineering. I have interned at Amazon (both Amazon.com and AWS) as an SDE. I am the director of R&D in <a href="https://purduemind.github.io/" target="_blank">Purdue MIND</a> where I am working on a muscle computer interface project and leading the organization's workshops. Some of my interests are robotics and IoT, so I like to do a lot of <a href="http://www.mghera.com/#/Gallery" target="_blank">personal projects</a> in those fields. I've made a few robots, such as a robotic arm that follows you around and an Astromech from Star Wars. Some non-technical interests of mine are watching anything Star Wars and reading DC comics.
