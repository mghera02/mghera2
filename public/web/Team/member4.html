	Hello! I am a junior in Computer Engineering. I come into this project with industry experience in autonomous vehicle simulation and real-time software emulation and hope to leverage these skills to hone our design. Some of my hobbies include watching college basketball, going to coffee shops, and learning about topics in programming or developments in tech. In addition, at Purdue I have been involved with organizations like IEEE Computer Society, Purdue Engineering Student Council, and Purdue Student Government.
