			Had the scheduled final presentation meeting at 2:30, however the micro decided to again not be working for some reason. So we told the professors that we will try to get it working and let them know if it does. We took all conectors out of the PCB and then I started to again probe everything. We were again getting the correct voltages. After about 30-45 minutes of the chip being dead it started it work for a second. Then it died again once we put it back in the shell and connected everything. So we then disconnected everything besides the motors and waiting to see if it would turn back on. After about 10 minutes it turned on, connected to wi-fi and the motors were working. We then reconnected everything, checked if they worked, which they did and then I got walter to come down. We then did the final demo and we got 4 of our base PSDRs and one stretch.

			We got the new micro soldered on. We then tested everything besides the motors, and they were all functional. I then soldered on the motor drive IC. We then went to test but for some reason nothing was working at all after soldering. I probed every single pin for almost 30 minutes with a voltage supplied to hopefully figure out what happened. Then for some reason after 30 minutes the micro just turned on. We believe that moisture trapped in areas was the cause for it not working. We then re-assembled everything and got videos of all components working correctly. We scheduled the final demo for tomorrow. We are still having an issue where it takes about 2 minutes with power supplied for the micro to “wake-up” we have no clue why and hope that it will work tomorrow during demo.

            <b>Work Time:</b> 8 hours <br>
			We got battery to start working and were also able to get the balancing charging function to also work correctly. Started on finalizing the packaging. We first worked on getting MOUSE to move straight and turn. We were getting issues that when turning it would only turn around 10 degrees due to friction from the wheels. We tried multiple things like only turning left wheels, first going straight then turning once at higher speed, turning with reversing other side wheels, none of these worked. In a last ditch effort we removed the tires from the wheels and ran it on the rims. This for some reason worked. We then moved onto getting the LEDs connected into the packaging. We printed a piece that press fit all the LEDs. I then number all 12 LEDs to correspond with a placement on each shift register. We then connected all LEDs and it worked correctly. We then moved onto the stepper. We had to use a slipring so I drilled a hole into the top of the packaging to fit the stepper and the slip ring it. We then connected the 3D printed attachment to the stepper and tested it, which worked. We then moved onto PIR. When testing we accidentally attached the wrong pins, this shorted the PIR and also shorted GND and 3.3V, this then backfired frying the micro and a motor drive IC. After this we desoldered the motor drive IC that was fried and after a long time of debugging decided to wait for tomorrow to have Joes help to solder a new micro on.

			Had trouble with one of the motor drivers not being able to have variable speed. Figured out that it was not software related so decided to desolder motor driver and resolder a new one. The new one on it worked, so we believe it was just a faulty chip. Started to test what starting speed we should use to make all motors start at same time. Worked some more on packaging. We started to have battery issues. Our li-po battery seems to not be fully functional. The charger says it has a low voltage error, so it wouldn’t charge it. To get around this we jump started the battery to get it to a higher voltage. This worked until we got another error which was incorrect readings for the cell count, we got around this by removing the data cable and instead charged it unbalanced. Hopefully this works, if not we may need a new battery.

			Finished soldering everything onto board. Tested all components of board with Matt and they all work, so if nothing bad happens we should be meeting all of our PSDRs besides the buck. Finished attaching MTAs to all of the LEDs. Started working on attaching the 3D printed shell to the metal chassis. It is already zip tied on; however, we cannot place the PCB directly on the metal, so we decided to use a thin wooden board. We drilled holes in the wooden board to place stand offs for our PCB. We then drilled more holes to zip tie the wood to the metal. We then drilled out a hole for the buck to be placed in so it can be accessed from the outside. Finally, we spray painted the bottom of the shell black.

			Met with team in ManLab. Soldered all of the motor controls onto the board. Worked on packaging and got the shell zip tied to the metal chassis. Soldered on the headers for steppers and motors. Soldered on the resistor for PIR. Currently don’t have the header for the PIR will need to get it from Joe. Started brainstorming on how we will use the slip ring to allow for the servo to rotate the PIR sensor.

            <b>Work Time:</b> 4.5 hours <br>
			Started to solder the 5th board. I soldered on LDO, heartbeats, ESP, USB, and UART. Got it working correctly we were able to flash. We found a pretty severe error in our schematic for the shift registers, so we are now going to use a proto board instead of the PCB for the shift registers. Andrew and Matt started to solder on the protoboard while I started to continue to work on packaging. I got a few more things glued. We also got a shift register working with the proto board. Soldered on all components that are used with the stepper motor. Did not have the header so I will do that in lab.

			Met with team in ManLab. Our current PCB is having troubling flashes, so we decided to resolder the USB port which will hopefully allow us to flash again. After resoldering the ESP was still unable to be flashes. We then removed the USB with hot air gun, and resoldered a new USB port to it, which also didn’t work. After this I decided to help Braden with packaging, we got to glue the whole entire bottom half of the packaging. We then tried to fit it to the chassis, which it did. Our next steps for packaging will be to continue gluing the upper half. For PCB we have decided to move forward and start soldering a new PCB. We also soldered  a USB to an older PCB that we thought was fried, however it actually works. The only bad thing is that the ESP seems to be semi fried, where it seems around 3 GPIO pins are burned out. We will work on this board alongside the new one and hopefully one will work.

			We finished soldering all the motor drive components; however, we are now having difficulties flashing the micro. Sometimes it flashes, other times it doesn’t. We reflowed all pads on the IC, which allowed us to flash our software. With this flashed we were able to get preliminary check off for the 2 PSDRS. Also got the PIR soldered and started gluing components for the packaging.

			<b>Hours this week:</b> 10 hours<hr> 

			<b>Date Reported:</b> 3/27/2024 <br>
            <b>Start Time:</b> 3:00pm <br>
            <b>Work Time:</b>  4.00 hours <br>
			Met with team in Man Lab. Braden and I started to work on the packaging that Matt had printed out. We first had to sand all of the joints so then when we super glue them they will stick better. We then ran into the issue that the clearance of the connecter joint was about 1.5mm too long. So I used the Dremel and cut the connector joint off, then shaved down 1.5mm. I then reconnected the connector joint with hot glue. After checking again, it seemed to line up correctly. I also gathered a metal and wooden dowel that we will use as joints between each piece of the packaging. 
			I then switched gears to help with debugging PCB, Matt and Andrew were unable to get the stepper motor to work. After probing with the oscilloscope, I believed that this was due to the LEDs in series will be created too much of a load not allowing for the current to move the motors. Thus, we desoldered the LEDs and shorted them. This allowed for the motor to work correctly. We then moved on to debugging the shift registers, after probing we believe that one of the GPIO pins in use for the LATCH is fried, so our next steps is to cut this trace and fly wire from a spare GPIO pin.

			Got ESP to start working. We started using the USB port instead of the UART, which allowed us to start flashing the ESP. I started soldering the LEDs to 28 AWG with a MTA connector. The shift registers were not giving the correct outputs for the LEDs, so I resoldered the shift registers to the board. They still weren’t working, we probed the GPIO pins to see if the had expected output, which they did. So we are confused to why the shift registers aren’t giving the correct output even though the GPIO pins are correct. Will need to do further debugging.

			The solder paste PCB did not work due to some short that was not detected during the x-ray. Due to this we decided to move forward with soldering a new PCB. We first soldered. The LDO, then we soldered the ESP and all of its components. We ran into an issue with the ESP being crooked, due to this we tried to desolder the ESP however, we accidentally pulled 3 pads in the process, however the ESP was saved. Due to this we resoldered another board with an LDO and ESP with all its components. This time the board looked good. We waited for it to dry then tested it. It did not respond to us trying to flash it. Thinking it may be a UART issue we soldered on the USB micro port which can also communicate with the ESP. We decided to not test this and instead get it x-rayed on Monday and move from there.

			Andrew and Braden soldered on the buck and coulomb using solder paste. I went to get an x-ray from the ECE lab, where a bridge between 2 pins on the buck was found. I fixed this then got it x rayed again, and this time there were no issues.

			Soldered on PB with decoupling caps and pull up resistors. With all supporting elements of the ESP soldered we will test if it is operational. When we tried to flash the ESP did not respond, we tested the dev board which did work. This means the ESP is fried, most likely due to soldering issues. </br>

			Team met for ManLab. Talked with course staff seems we are headed in a good direction with our main focus only being on PCB now. Helped Andrew solder on the heartbeat led for 3.3V. Worked with Andrew to solder the ESP on. Got ESP soldered as well as the decoupling capacitors and resistors. Ran into issue when the 0hm resistor pads got scorched. So, we fly wired from C2 3.3V to R2 ESP 3.3V. We still need to solder the PBs on before we can test if ESP is functional. </br>

			Continued to debug the buck converter. First checked if the 5V plane is working. Connected 5V and GND from the power supply and saw that the heartbeat for the 5V was on, so the 5V plane is working. Then ran a simulation on web bench to get correct values for the buck converter. The Vin and Vpg are correct, but it would be almost impossible for these to be incorrect. The Vout is very off with us currently getting 0.8V which is not even close to 5V. Its pretty much impossible to measure current on a PCB so I can’t gain information on if those values are correct. Joe advised me to move on from buck and start soldering other components. I soldered the 5V to 3.3V LDO.  The output of the LDO is currently 4.1V which is very confusing. I checked it with a load box to put a load on it but am still getting just 4.1V. Walter said that the chip might be the wrong one, because I got it from the community shelves so someone may have put an incorrect one in. I decided to unsolder the chip and solder a new one on. With the new chip on I now get an output of 3.3V so it was the incorrect chip. Started gathering the materials needed for the heartbeat LED and the ESP so I can start soldering those next. </br>

			Met up with Matt due to him having issues with the bucking converter on the PCB. It is currently outputting the incorrect voltage, so we tried to troubleshoot why this way happening. We decided to probe the voltages, which gave us incorrect readings. We then measured the resistance on all the PCB resistors and found strange results where they did not match what we think they should be. Our next steps are to simulate the bucking in spice to find the correct voltages on each pin, then possibly solder onto a new board.</br>

			Went to the lab with Andrew and Matt to start soldering components onto the PCB. Arrived a bit late so the QFN for the coulomb was already soldered. So, we started on the bucking converter. Found an error in the PCB where the pads for the top left right and bottom left were not printed on the PCB for some reason. We tried to figure out why but don’t understand what happened, our footprint on KiCad is correct so we are very confused. We talked to joe about this and thankfully these pads were on large traces, so Joe taught us how to scrap off the solder mask and create new pads for us to use. We practiced on junk PCBs then I created the new pads on our PCB. I then helped Matt to solder on the QFN. I held the chip in place and monitored using the camera to make sure none of the pins bridged. It took a while, but we got the buck soldered and checked with an x-ray in the ECE shop to make sure the joints were good. </br>

			Helped Andrew with rerouting parts of the Coulomb counter, after he increased the trace size for 18V it was very hard to access the 0805 resistor. So I recommended he change it to 2512, which we did. I then made sure that all trace sizes are large enough and found that a few traces on the motors are too small. So changed them from .25mm to .6mm. Also decided to hand solder all offboard LEDs instead of buying them. </br>

Found that the current circuit was wired incorrectly, first switched to another motor drive dev kit to make sure the original wiring I did from 3 weeks ago was still working. Then once it was working switched back to the newer dev kit. Decided to instead make code from scratch, due to Braden’s code not working. Matt and I got working code, thus PWM is now working with the ESP.	</br>

Then I organized and labeled each individual section of the schematic, sectioning them off in rectangles. Talked to TA and found mistake in the schematic with the CHIP_PU, fixed and now should be correct. Also learned that the bucking converter requires both an PGND and AGND plane, so relabeled both grounds to be different. Now have a AGND for part of bucking and PGND for everything else. Also discussed with TA if we are allowed to leave the 5V output from USB connected to out power plane, he said he was unsure and we should ask Joe if we should keep or remove it.</br>

			After speaking with the team, we decided to switch from the SLA battery to a li-po battery due to weight concerns with the chassis. The only li-po that joe current has in stock is an 18.4V one, due to this we can no longer run the motor voltage directly from the motor, so we will instead power the motors with 5V from the step down circuit. With this change I prototyped the motors at 5V, and found that they will still run, the only downside is we will need to run the PWM signal to have around a 90-100% duty cycle due to this lower voltage input. We also decided to switch from sonar sensors to IR sensors after running into a large number of issues with the sonar sensors. We ordered the IR sensors and should arrive this weekend </br>

Then got a 2nd power supply which will allow me to test 2 motors at the same time, due to having now 2A output combined. Found that when runn at 100 PWM that the current draw is a steady 0.8, will play around with different PWM to see what is the most efficent.

However, KiCad did not have a schematic for this IC so I researched how to add a custom IC. I found a website that has custom schematics and downloaded the one for LM3940. I found a few mistakes in the schematic, including incorrect Vcc for sonars, wrong wiring resulting in shorts, and messy wiring which I cleaned up. </br>

			Met with my cousin who is a power electronics engineer from MIT to talk about my current power concerns on the system. We went over what I currently had, in which he most agreed with what I was doing. He advised me on a few things; 1) ask for a PSU with 3A-5A output to test circuitry before buying a battery 2) Buy a smaller battery that lasts ~ 5 minutes to check for operation 3) The motors are rated for 6V however the 12V source can be directly used due to the usage of PWM for controlled, thus average voltage will be below 6V due to duty cycle 4) A linear regulator is fine for 12V to 5V and 5V to 3.3V because the motors are not being run off of a regulator so efficiency should still be okay. My next steps are to communicate this feedback with my team. </br>

I then connected the Arduino to both motor drivers and tried to run 1 motor per motor driver. I first controlled both motor drivers with different PWM; however, this did not work due to the current stall of the motors. I then thought that it may work if I use the same PWM for both motor drives, however I ran into the same problem. I believe that the current will not be an issue once we receive the actual battery we will use, because currently the PSU only outputs a max of 1 amp, however the actual battery should output more. A picture of the new circuit can be seen below. </br>

			Researched the correct motor drives to power our motors. Met with Joe to figure out what motor drives he currently had in stock. Decided to use the TB6612FNG motor drives that he had in stock. This motor drive allows for the control of 2 motors at the same time. Then researched information on the motor drive pinouts and how to use them to control the motors. Decided to do a quick prototype using an Arduino Uno due to the code being easier than using the esp32. Built prototype to test if the motor drives would power. Using the power generator, I produced 12V 1A to the motor power port, however, the current limit of 1A only allowed for 1 motor to work at a time. Due to the motors’ high current draw we have decided to find less powerful motors because our robot will not need to go at a high speed. The next step is to order our 12V lead acid battery and less powerful motors and see if the current output is sufficient. I have pictured the built motor drive circuit below. </br>

			Added the step-down circuit to the schematic. Also found out that the esp32 model we are using needs a 3.3V input so also had to add a way to take down the 5V output to 3.3V. Decided the easiest way to do this was to use a voltage divider. So now we have a 12V to 5V step down circuit with the 5V output powering all ICs and other things that will need 5V, then we have a 5V to 3.3V voltage divider whose output will power the esp. This can all be seen below. Currently the voltage divider is temporary as it may be inefficient, however will need to investigate other options further. </br>

			Gathered all materials necessary to create 12V to 5V set down circuit. The exact transistor and zener diode were unavailable at the ECE shop so decided to choose a different one. The new transisitor is BC548 and diode is 5.6V 1000mA, these differ slightly than previously wanted and will resulst in a 5V 200mA output instead of 500mA. For now these will be fine to prototype but will need to order other materials to build final version. Built and tested the circuit. It worked correctly, as seen in the images below I supply 12V from DC power supply and measured ~5V with the multimeter on the output. I also witness that becuase of the large capaictor size the discharge rate is relatively slow and takes around 20ish minutes to fully discharge, this may or may not be an issue in the future but is good to remark incase it is. Met with teammate Matt to ensure that the 5V output would power the esp32, which it did. </br>

			Researched power options for esp32. Decided to use a 12V lead acid battery with 20AH. Used this battery due to inexpensive cost and high amp hours. Due to output voltage being 12V need to step down voltage to 5V to allow for safest powering of esp32. Researched average esp32 current draw found that at max usage esp32 may use around 150 – 300mA, due to this 12V to 5V circuit should have higher mA than this. Found circuit that converts 12V to 5V with 500mA. To build this circuit will need transistor BD139 and 5.6V 0.5w Zener diode. Created document to hold all power related information   </br>

			Helped to dissemble and test all drive motors in the robot chassis. Verified that all the motors were correctly working when a voltage between 1-12V was applied. Wrote short Arduino IDE script to see if motors can be controlled via PWM directly from a microcontroller. Found that current is too low so will need to find a motor drive IC to use.  </br>

			Started and finished final project proposal with team during lab time. Went on lab tour. Brainstormed with team for best possible way to dectect movement. Decided we will use a combination of ultra sonic and lidar sensors. We also decided to use a premade chassis and then 3D print the robots body. Gathered components for our project, including a robot chassis, LEDs, and shift registers.  </br>
