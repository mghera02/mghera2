            "description": "For my senior design project, I, alongside my team of 3 computer engineering colleagues, am building a mobile surveillance robot. MOUSE is a mobile surveillance robot intended for indoor use, in corporate office or residential environments. MOUSE will be powered by four motors, each controlling its own wheel for mobility. There will be a large 18V battery allowing MOUSE to perform surveillance overnight without needing to have its battery replaced. When the battery does die, it will need to be recharged manually. MOUSE will have the ability for the motors to have variable speed control through the use of PWM signals. MOUSE will also have a custom circuit to step down the 18V from the battery to 5V for motors, sensors and ICs, as well as 5V to 3.3V for the microprocessor. To complete its surveillance functionality, MOUSE will have PIR sensors on all four sides, allowing for the detection of movement. While stationary, MOUSE will use these sensors to detect any movement in its vicinity. Finally, there will be a viewable UI on a webpage to use MOUSE movement controls and display if any objects have been detected. MOUSE and the web interface will send data wirelessly through WiFi via a web server. The block diagram below represents the connections between the described functional components of MOUSE. Additionally, we have the following stretch goals for the functionality of MOUSE. The PIR sensors may be mounted to a motor to ensure 360 degree coverage, instead of simply mounting four separate sensors to each side of MOUSE. MOUSE may be able to follow a predetermined path set by the user. On the right, you can scroll through my progress journal to see my individual contributions (updated as of 2/22/24).",

The project I have been working on in this team is called KTT (Keep the Tempo) where I have been the design lead for a few semesters. This project is based around designing a deaf and hard of hearing accessible solution to a commonly used device for swimmers, called a tempo trainer. I and my team have designed a two piece solution that uses a WiFi mesh to communciate between a remote and tempo trainer that emits light instead of sound.",

            "description": "As part of my work as the director of Research & Development in Purdue MIND (Medical, Innovation, Networking, Design), I created and led a series of workshops for the club. These workshops helped both new and experienced members learn more about how to prototype with Arduinos. These workshops covered circuit design, microcontroller programming, and how to interface with different external peripherals. The first workshop covers basic fundamentals of programming and circuit design with Arduinos and then begins to go into some more complex concepts like shift registers. The second workshop focuses on combining everything taught in the first workshop into one single device and mixes in some new concepts like external interrupts and I2C communication protocol.",

            "description": "Throughout my Amazon AWS internship, I spent my time designing and creating a Ruby-based dashboard that will help drastically decrease the mitigation time for operators when solving Lustre-specific tickets. This dashboard utilizes the AWS CloudWatch API to display metrics on a per-filesystem basis for AutoExport, AutoImport, HSM, and other metrics. Not only are these graphs customizable and easily extendable, they will also help operators quickly find correlations between metrics. To further aid in both decreased mitigation time and reducing manual SSH access, I also developed bash script commands that will bypass the need for operators to SSH into file systems and still execute the respective command. Through the process of creating this dashboard, I gained experience learning a lot about AWS, its infrastructure, and its tools, and I learned more about being a developer. Unfortunately, I won't be able to share a video of the working dashboard, but trust me, it was cool.",

If the room is too dark to detect faces, an led face-light will automatically turn on so that a face can be detected. It has integrated speakers and a microphone to be given audible commands and output audible responses along with playing some music. Dum-E also has an LCD screen to display responses and errors.",
