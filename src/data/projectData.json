            "description": "Dum-E is an Iron Man inspired robot. It uses a Raspberry Pi to drive it, and is programmed in Python. It also uses OpenCV to track faces, and three servo motors to follow the tracked face, so that it can move in 3-dimensions. If the room is too dark to detect faces, an led face-light will automatically turn on so that a face can be detected. It has integrated speakers and a microphone to be given audible commands and output audible responses along with playing some music. Dum-E also has an LCD screen to display responses and errors.",
