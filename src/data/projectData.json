            "description": "For my senior design project, I, alongside my team of 3 computer engineering colleagues, built a mobile surveillance robot. MOUSE is a mobile surveillance robot intended for indoor use, in corporate office or residential environments. MOUSE is powered by four motors, each controlling its own wheel for mobility. It uses an 18V battery allowing MOUSE to perform surveillance overnight without needing to have its battery replaced. When the battery does die, it is recharged manually. MOUSE has the ability for the motors to have variable speed control through the use of PWM signals. MOUSE also has a custom circuit to step down the 18V from the battery to 5V for motors, sensors and ICs, as well as 5V to 3.3V for the microprocessor. To complete its surveillance functionality, MOUSE has a PIR sensors attached to a stepper motor, allowing for the detection of movement. While stationary, MOUSE uses this sensor to detect any movement in its vicinity. Finally, there is a viewable UI on a webpage to use MOUSE movement controls and display if any objects have been detected. MOUSE and the web interface send data wirelessly through WiFi via a web server.",

The project I had been working on in this team was called KTT (Keep the Tempo) where I had been the design lead for 3 semesters. This project was based around designing a deaf and hard of hearing accessible solution to a commonly used device for swimmers, called a tempo trainer. I and my team designed a two piece solution that used a WiFi mesh to communciate between a remote and a tempo trainer that emits light instead of sound.",

These workshops helped both new and experienced members learn more about how to prototype with Arduinos. These workshops covered circuit design, microcontroller programming, and how to interface with different external peripherals. The first workshop covers basic fundamentals of programming and circuit design with Arduinos and then begins to go into some more complex concepts like shift registers. The second workshop focuses on combining everything taught in the first workshop into one single device and mixes in some new concepts like external interrupts and I2C communication protocol.",

            "description": "Throughout my Amazon AWS internship, I spent my time designing and creating a Ruby-based dashboard that will help drastically decrease the mitigation time for operators when solving Lustre-specific tickets. This dashboard utilizes the AWS CloudWatch API to display metrics on a per-filesystem basis for AutoExport, AutoImport, HSM, and other metrics. Not only are these graphs customizable and easily extendable, they will also help operators quickly find correlations between metrics. To further aid in both decreased mitigation time and reducing manual SSH access, I also developed bash script commands that will bypass the need for operators to SSH into file systems and still execute the respective command. Through the process of creating this dashboard, I gained experience learning a lot about AWS, its infrastructure, and its tools, and I learned more about being a developer.",

If the room is too dark to detect faces, an led face-light will automatically turn on so that a face can be detected. It has integrated speakers and a microphone to be given audible commands and output audible responses along with playing some music. Dum-E also has an LCD screen to display responses and errors.",
